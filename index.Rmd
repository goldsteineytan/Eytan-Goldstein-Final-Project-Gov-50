## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to comparing voting data in Eastern Europe with GDP per capita. I want to study the correlation between low voting/ low interest in democracy in areas that have struggled to transition from socialism to a capitalistic market system since the fall of the Soviet Union and its satellite states in the 1990s.In essence, I want to study how voting patters across Eastern European states is affected by their economic gains since the introduction of market bassed economic models. Obviously, this is a broad topic and I will need to find the requisite data sets to follow through with this. Nevertheless, it is a start.
